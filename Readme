# 42 Singapore: Systems Engineering & C 🇸🇬

> **Current Focus:** Transitioning from High-Level Analytics (Python/R) to Low-Level Engineering (C).

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository contains my coursework and solutions for the **42 Singapore** curriculum. I am using this journey to master the "black box" of computer science—understanding how memory, compilation, and algorithms work at the hardware abstraction layer. In many ways, this is my "leap into the unknown," moving from data insights to the foundational logic that powers them.

### [00. The Piscine (March 2025)]
*Location: `/Piscine (Mar 2025)`* The intensive 26-day selection bootcamp that made this journey possible. These projects were built from scratch using only `write`, `malloc`, and `free`.

| Project | Key Concepts Mastered | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C00** | **Basic Syntax:** `write` syscall, char/int manipulation, loops. | ✅ Done |
| **C01** | **Pointers:** Memory addresses, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic. | ✅ Done |
| **C02** | **Strings:** Raw string manipulation and buffer handling. | ✅ Done |
| **C03** | **String Lib:** Recreating `libc` functions like `strcat` and `strstr`. | ✅ Done |
| **C04** | **Parsing:** `atoi` implementation and recursive parsing. | ✅ Done |
| **C05** | **Algorithms:** Iterative vs Recursive factorials and prime finding. | ✅ Done |
| **C06** | **CLI Args:** Handling `argc` and `argv` input validation. | ✅ Done |
| **C07** | **Memory Allocation:** Mastering `malloc` and `free`. | ✅ Done |
| **C08** | **Headers & Structs:** Preprocessor macros and typedefs. | ✅ Done |
| **Shell 01 & 02**| **Unix/Bash:** Permissions, piping, and environment variables. | ✅ Done |

### [01. Common Core]
*The main engineering track. These projects focus on building robust, reusable libraries and understanding system-level I/O.*

#### [Circle 0 & 1: The Foundations]
| Project | Description & Key Concepts | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Libft** | **The Standard Library:** Reimplementing 40+ standard functions (e.g., `memset`, `calloc`). | ✅ Done |
| **ft_printf** | **Variadic Functions:** Managing variable argument lists to mimic `printf`. | ✅ Done |
| **get_next_line**| **Static Variables:** Reading lines from file descriptors without memory leaks. | ✅ Done |
| **Born2beroot** | **Virtualization:** Setting up a strict Debian server with LVM, SSH, and UFW. | ✅ Done |

#### [Circle 2: Complexity & Communication]
| Project | Description & Key Concepts | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **fract-ol** | **2D Graphics:** Real-time Mandelbrot/Julia sets using complex math and MiniLibX. | ✅ Done |
| **minitalk** | **IPC & Bitwise Logic:** Data exchange using UNIX signals (`SIGUSR1`/`SIGUSR2`). | ✅ Done |

### [Exam Rank 02 Preparation]
*Location: `/42 Exam Rank 02`* Algorithmic challenges solved under time pressure without external libraries.
* **Level 1 & 2:** String searches, bitwise operations, and `atoi` implementation.
* **Level 3 & 4:** Advanced math (`lcm`) and linked list manipulation.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Constraints
* **Language:** C (C99 standard).
* **Style:** Strict adherence to **Norminette** (42's coding standard).
* **Memory Management:** Zero tolerance for memory leaks; manual heap management is an absolute requirement.
