# 42 Singapore: Systems Engineering & C 🇸🇬

> **Current Focus:** transitioning from High-Level Analytics (Python/R) to Low-Level Engineering (C).

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository contains my coursework and solutions for the **42 Singapore** curriculum. I am using this journey to master the "black box" of computer science—understanding how memory, compilation, and algorithms work at the hardware abstraction layer.

## 📂 Project Directory

### 1. 🏊 The Piscine (March 2025)
*Location: `/Piscine (Mar 2025)`*
Code developed during the intensive 26-day selection bootcamp. These projects were built from scratch using only `write`, `malloc`, and `free`.

| Project | Key Concepts Mastered | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C00** | **Basic Syntax:** `write` syscall, char/int manipulation, loops. | ✅ Done |
| **C01** | **Pointers:** Memory addresses, dereferencing, swapping values, pointer arithmetic. | ✅ Done |
| **C02** | **Strings:** Raw string manipulation, ASCII arithmetic, buffer handling. | ✅ Done |
| **C03** | **String Lib:** Recreating `libc` functions (`strcat`, `strstr`, `strncat`). | ✅ Done |
| **C04** | **Parsing:** `atoi` implementation, base conversion (Hex/Binary), recursive parsing. | ✅ Done |
| **C05** | **Algorithms:** Iterative vs Recursive factorials, square roots, prime finding. | ✅ Done |
| **C06** | **CLI Args:** Handling `argc` and `argv`, program input validation. | ✅ Done |
| **C07** | **Memory Allocation:** `malloc`, `free`, creating dynamic arrays, memory leaks. | ✅ Done |
| **C08** | **Headers & Structs:** Preprocessor macros, `#ifndef` protection, typedefs. | 🚧 In Progress |
| **Shell**| **Unix/Bash:** File permissions, piping, grep/awk, environment variables. | ✅ Done |

### 2. ⚔️ Exam Rank 02 Preparation
*Location: `/42 Exam Rank 02`*
This folder contains my practice solutions for the strict 42 Exams. These are algorithmic challenges that must be solved without external libraries in a time-constrained environment.
* **Level 1:** String searches, character swapping, FizzBuzz.
* **Level 2:** Bitwise operations, math implementation, `atoi` / `itoa`.
* **Level 3:** [In Progress]
* **Level 4:** [In Progress]

## 🏗️ Upcoming Projects to be committed to Github
- [ ] **Libft:** Building my own standard library to use in future C projects.
- [ ] **ft_printf:** Recreating the logic behind variable argument lists.
- [ ] **get_next_line:** Reading a line from a file descriptor using static variables/buffers.
- [ ] **Born2beroot:** Virtualization, LVM partitions, and SSH configuration.

## 🛠️ Technical Constraints
* **Language:** C (C99 standard).
* **Style:** Strict adherence to **Norminette** (42's coding standard).
* **Forbidden Functions:** No standard library functions allowed (except `write`, `malloc`, `free`, `read`) unless specified.
* **Memory Management:** Zero tolerance for memory leaks (managed via manual heap allocation).
