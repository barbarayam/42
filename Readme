# 42 Singapore: The C Journey 🇸🇬

> "Learning C has been about more than just syntax; it is about building the discipline to understand how things work under the hood."

## 👋 About This Project
Welcome to my digital notebook, this repository documents my progression through the **42 Singapore** curriculum. 

It serves two purposes:
1.  **Technical Archive:** A collection of my solutions, refactored code, and study notes.
2.  **Growth Tracker:** A timeline of moving from low-code solutions to low-level memory management.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 🏊 Piscine (Mar 2025 to April 2025)
*The intense 26-day C programming bootcamp.*

### 🎓 42 Cursus (Circle 1 & 2) - (June 2025 to Sept 2025) *Upcoming*
*The Core Curriculum. Deepening the understanding of C.*
- [ ] **Libft**: Creating my very own standard library.
- [ ] **ft_printf**: Recreating the famous printf function.
- [ ] **get_next_line**: Reading a line from a file descriptor.
- [ ] **Born2beroot**: System administration and virtualization.
- [ ] **Push_swap**: Sorting algorithms and complexity analysis.

### ⚔️ Exam Rank Practice
My personal sandbox for practicing exam questions under time constraints.
* **Level 1:** Basic algorithms (FizzBuzz, searches).
* **Level 2:** Bitwise operations, math.
* **Level 3:** [In Progress]
* **Level 4:** [In Progress]

## 🛠️ How to Test
To test any specific file, I typically compile using `gcc` with the strict 42 flags:

```bash
# Example compilation
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror filename.c -o output_name
./output_name
