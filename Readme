# 42 Exam Rank 02 — Study Repository 📚

### About This Project
Welcome to my digital notebook. This repository documents my journey through the C curriculum at 42 Singapore. 

Learning C has been about more than just syntax; it is about building the discipline to understand how things work under the hood. This collection represents my practice solutions for **Exam Rank 02**, broken down by difficulty levels.

### 📂 Repository Structure
* **Level 1:** Basic algorithms (FizzBuzz, string searches, swaps).
* **Level 2:** Intermediate challenges (Bitwise operations, math, string manipulation).
* **Level 3:** [In Progress]
* **Level 4:** [In Progress]

### 🛠️ How to Test
To test any specific file, I typically compile using `gcc` with the standard flags:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror filename.c -o output_name
./output_name
