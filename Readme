# 42 Singapore: Systems Engineering & C 🇸🇬

> **Current Focus:** transitioning from High-Level Analytics (Python/R) to Low-Level Engineering (C).

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository contains my coursework and solutions for the **42 Singapore** curriculum. I am using this journey to master the "black box" of computer science—understanding how memory, compilation, and algorithms work at the hardware abstraction layer.

## 📂 Project Directory

### 1. 🚀 Core Curriculum (Circle 1)
*The main engineering track. These projects focus on building robust, reusable libraries and understanding system-level I/O.*

| Project | Description & Key Concepts | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
circle 0
| **Libft** | **The Standard Library:** My first C library. I reimplemented 40+ standard C functions (e.g., `memset`, `strlcat`, `calloc`) and custom linked-list manipulation tools. This library serves as the foundation for all future C projects. | ✅ Done |
Circle 1
| **ft_printf** | **Variadic Functions:** A mimic of the standard `printf`. Handles variable argument lists (`va_list`) and parses format specifiers (`cspdiuxX%`) to manage standard output directly. | ✅ Done |
| **get_next_line**| **Static Variables & File Descriptors:** Reading a line from a file descriptor efficiently, managing buffers and memory leaks across multiple function calls. | 🚧 Next Up |
| **Born2beroot** | **Virtualization & SysAdmin:** Setting up a strict Debian server, configuring LVM partitions, SSH, UFW firewalls, and password policies. | ⏳ Pending |
Circle 2
| **fract-ol | **2D Graphics & Optimization:** A fractal exploration engine built with MiniLibX. It renders mathematically infinite patterns (Mandelbrot, Julia sets) in real-time. Features include infinite zoom, color shifts, and dynamic parameter adjustments using complex number arithmetic and event hooks.  | ⏳ Pending |

### 2. ⚔️ Exam Rank 02 Preparation
*Location: `/42 Exam Rank 02`*
This folder contains my practice solutions for the strict 42 Exams. These are algorithmic challenges that must be solved without external libraries in a time-constrained environment.
* **Level 1:** String searches, character swapping, FizzBuzz.
* **Level 2:** Bitwise operations, math implementation, `atoi` / `itoa`.
* **Level 3:** `ft_range`, `hidenp`, `lcm`.
* **Level 4:** Sort list, list manipulation.

### 3. 🏊 The Piscine (Selection Phase)
*Location: `/Piscine (Mar 2025)`*
Code developed during the intensive 26-day selection bootcamp. These projects were built from scratch using only `write`, `malloc`, and `free`.

| Project | Key Concepts Mastered | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C00** | **Basic Syntax:** `write` syscall, char/int manipulation, loops. | ✅ Done |
| **C01** | **Pointers:** Memory addresses, dereferencing, swapping values, pointer arithmetic. | ✅ Done |
| **C02** | **Strings:** Raw string manipulation, ASCII arithmetic, buffer handling. | ✅ Done |
| **C03** | **String Lib:** Recreating `libc` functions (`strcat`, `strstr`, `strncat`). | ✅ Done |
| **C04** | **Parsing:** `atoi` implementation, base conversion (Hex/Binary), recursive parsing. | ✅ Done |
| **C05** | **Algorithms:** Iterative vs Recursive factorials, square roots, prime finding. | ✅ Done |
| **C06** | **CLI Args:** Handling `argc` and `argv`, program input validation. | ✅ Done |
| **C07** | **Memory Allocation:** `malloc`, `free`, creating dynamic arrays, memory leaks. | ✅ Done |
| **C08** | **Headers & Structs:** Preprocessor macros, `#ifndef` protection, typedefs. | ✅ Done |
| **Shell 01 and Shell 02**| **Unix/Bash:** File permissions, piping, grep/awk, environment variables. | ✅ Done |

## 🛠️ Technical Constraints
* **Language:** C (C99 standard).
* **Style:** Strict adherence to **Norminette** (42's coding standard).
* **Forbidden Functions:** No standard library functions allowed (except `write`, `malloc`, `free`, `read`) unless specified.
* **Memory Management:** Zero tolerance for memory leaks (managed via manual heap allocation).

*Note: This code is for educational portfolio purposes. If you are a 42 Student, please do not copy/paste. The struggle to build these from scratch is the only way to pass the Exam.*
